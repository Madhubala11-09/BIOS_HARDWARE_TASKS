command and data fetched from memory
## alu - arithmetic logical unit
# input/output unit
the memory of other functions of the executed program is overwritten, potentially creating a security vulnerability.
how:

the memory is divided and used
the debugger displays and names the individual instructions
the debugger can be used to detect such vulnerabilities
we can manipulate the memory
Process for Identifying Bad Characters
Send All Characters: Create a payload containing all bytes from \x00 to \xFF and send it to the application to trigger a crash.
Inspect Memory: Use a debugger (e.g., Immunity Debugger, GDB) to view the ESP register or the memory address where the payload was sent.
Identify Breaks: Examine the sequence of characters. If a byte is missing, replaced, or causes subsequent bytes to be skipped (e.g., \x00 acting as a string terminator), that byte is a bad character.
Remove and Re-test: Remove the offending character from the payload, update the script, and repeat the process until the entire sequence appears correctly in memory.
